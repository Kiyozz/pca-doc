# MO2

_You did not configure PCA yet? Then go [here](configuration) first_.

There are two methods to set up PCA alongside MO2. Start PCA and go to the settings page.

## First

- `using mo2`: check this box.
- `mo2 instance`: this is the instance folder of your MO2 installation.
  Mainly, the folder containing `downloads`, `mods`, `overwrite` folders.

  PCA will then detect all the files needed for the compilation.

## Second

When running PCA inside MO2, you do not need to use PCA's MO2 integration.

- `using mo2`: uncheck this box.
