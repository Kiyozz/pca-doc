# Configuration

You can follow the in-app tutorial if you are starting PCA for the first time.

Start PCA and go to the settings page.

### Game

- `game path`: this is your game folder. Mainly, the folder containing the exe of your game.
- `compiler path`: if you correctly install CK,
  you'll have a file named `PapyrusCompiler.exe` inside the `{game path}\Papyrus Compiler` folder. This is what PCA needs to compile your files.

### Compilation

- `concurrent scripts`: number of scripts compiled at the same time (default: `15`).
  PCA has a feature called "concurrent scripts" that can compile multiple scripts at the same time.

### MO2
