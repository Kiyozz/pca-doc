# Command line is too long

If you have this error, you're using MO2 PCA's integration.

MO2 integration has a limitation due to Windows Command Line capability.

Refer to the [second way](../getting-started/mo2#second) to configure PCA.

If you already did that, then, please share [any debug log](../support).
