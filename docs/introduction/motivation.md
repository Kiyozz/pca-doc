# Motivation

Creation Kit is the tool to compile `.psc` into `.pex`. But CK lack performances, and a good User experience/User interface.

This is why PCA is born.

Development of PCA started in 2018. It is created by Lyrod, who has many usernames: Wk (mainly), Kiyozz (Github), and WushuLate (Nexus mods username).

PCA first focus is user experience, and the user interface.

It has great features, and helps the mod developer to compile files easily.
