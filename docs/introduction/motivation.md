# Motivation

Creation Kit is the tool to compile `.psc` into `.pex`. But CK lack performances, and a good User experience/User interface.

This is why PCA is born.

Development of PCA started in 2018. It is created by Lyrod,
who has many usernames: Wk (mainly), [Kiyozz](https://github.com/Kiyozz) (Github), and [WushuLate](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/10659062) (Nexus mods username).

PCA first focus is user experience, and user interface.

PCA helps the mod developer with many great features.
