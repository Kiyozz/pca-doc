# Installation

## Download PCA

[Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23852) the latest version of PCA on Nexus mods and extract it anywhere you want.
It is **not recommended** to install PCA inside a directory that needs admin privileges (mainly Program Files folder).

## Requirements

PCA requires **Creation Kit** (CK) to compile your files. _More ways could come later_.

- For AE/SE/VR/LE: CK is available on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/).
  Download it from your Steam library in **Tools** section.
- For FO4: CK is available on the [Bethesda Launcher](https://www.bethesda.net/en/game/bethesda-launcher).

  :::warning
  Bethesda Launcher will be removed in 2022. Make sure to [migrate to Steam](https://bethesda.net/en/article/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam).

:::note
You need to extract the file `Data\Scripts.zip` which contains all basic psc files
to compile any papyrus script. This file is available when CK is installed.
