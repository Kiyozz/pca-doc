# 5.5.2

### Bug fixes

- Fix the new version popup background in light theme

- FO4 support - Creation Kit installation

  PCA was checking your Creation Kit installation by searching for `YOUR_GAME/Data/Scripts/Source/Actor.psc` file.

  This was invalid because Fallout 4 use `YOUR_GAME/Data/Scripts/Source/Base/Actor.psc`
